# Ruby on Rails Onepage Portfolio

This is my repository of my one-page portfolio. You can navigate it by scrolling down with your mouse, or by clicking in the Menu section.

- It is written in Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3, and some jQuery javascript. 
- It can be shown as in English as in Spanish.
- It has a contact form that uses mailer to send you the messages.
- It also has an admin side accessible online for the project management.

To use it you should initialize using the `settings.yml` configuration file.


You can see it running online at: https://helenaweb.herokuapp.com/

Enjoy!
