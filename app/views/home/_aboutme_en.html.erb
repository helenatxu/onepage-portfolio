		<p class="eng">I’m Helena Moreno Chacón, a <strong>web designer</strong> &amp; <strong>developer</strong> born in Toledo, Spain. I spent one year studying in Poland under the <em>Erasmus Program</em>, but currently I'm living in Charlottesville, Virgina, USA.</p>
		
		<p class="eng">Although I graduated in <strong>Bachelor of Computer Science</strong>, I mostly enjoy designing and developing small to medium-sized websites.
		That’s why I love using <strong>html5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>jQuery</strong> and <strong>Ruby on Rails framework</strong> to develop my projects, and to continue learning new technologies. Also it's important for me that the code I write is semantically correct, <strong>SEO optimized</strong> and follows <strong>W3C standards</strong>.</p>

		<p id="more">When I am not working, I like to learn languages, meet my friends and read books (my favorite book is <em>The Eight</em>). I also enjoy a lot watching some movies or series, and planning the next trip... I love to travel!</p>
