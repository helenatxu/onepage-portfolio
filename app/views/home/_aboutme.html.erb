	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<div class="container">
		<p>I just complete one year in an internship in the City Council of Valencia (Spain). Before this I earned my degree in Bachelor of Computer Science from the Technical University of Valencia. My last year of studies (2009-2010) was spent in Poland under the Erasmus Program to study abroad with a learning agreement between my home faculty and the International Faculty of Engineering of the Technical University of Lodz.</p>
