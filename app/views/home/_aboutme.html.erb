	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<div id="aboutbox">
		<p>I’m Helena Moreno Chacón, a web designer &amp; developer born in Toledo. I spent one year living in Poland under the <em>Erasmus Program</em>, but currently living in Valencia, Spain.</p>
		
		<p>Although I was graduated in <b>Bachelor of Computer Science</b>, I mostly enjoy on designing and developing small to medium-sized websites.
		That’s why I love <b>html</b>, <b>css</b>, <b>jQuery</b> and <b>Ruby on Rails framework</b>. Also It’s important for me a code that follows W3C web standards (valid and semantic) and SEO optimized.</p>
		<p>If you want to know more academic details and others, you can <a class="link" href="/assets/docs/CurriculumVitae_HelenaMorenoChacon.pdf">download my CV</a>.</p>

		<p id="more">When I am not developing a website, I like to learn languages, meeting with my friends, reading a book (my favorite book is <em>The Eight</em>). 
		Also I enjoy a lot watching some movies or series, and planning the next trip... I love travel!
